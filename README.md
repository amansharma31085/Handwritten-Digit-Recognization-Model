# Handwritten Digit Recognition Model

A web-based application for recognizing handwritten digits (0–9) using a machine learning model. Users can draw a digit on the interface, and the app predicts the number based on the trained model.

---

## Features

* **Interactive drawing interface**: Draw digits directly in your browser using the web UI (`app.py`).
* **Predictive model**: Fast and accurate digit recognition powered by a trained neural network (`model.py`).
* **Flexible training**: (Re)train the model using your own data or standard datasets with `train.py`.
* **Web deployment ready**: Easily run locally or deploy using frameworks like Flask.

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amansharma31085/Handwritten-Digit-Recognization-Model.git
cd Handwritten-Digit-Recognization-Model
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Then install necessary Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> *If there's no `requirements.txt` present, you can install common packages like:*
> `flask`, `tensorflow` or `keras`, `numpy`, `Pillow`, etc.

## How to Use

### 1. Train the Model

To (re)train the neural network:

```bash
python train.py
```

This script should handle dataset loading (e.g., MNIST), model training, evaluation, and saving the trained model (e.g., as `model.h5` or similar).

### 2. Launch the Web App

Run the application:

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (or specified host/port).

### 3. Draw and Recognize

Draw a digit in the web interface and submit it. The backend will process the input, run the model, and return a predicted digit (0–9).

---

## Project Workflow

1. **Training**: Use `train.py` to build and save the model.
2. **Serving**: `app.py` loads the trained model and hosts the UI.
3. **User Interaction**: User draws digit → UI captures it → Backend predicts → Response displayed.

---

## Requirements

* Python 3.7+
* Flask (or equivalent web framework)
* Deep learning library: TensorFlow or Keras
* Other utilities: NumPy, Pillow, OpenCV (if preprocessing images)
